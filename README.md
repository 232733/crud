Crud:
  CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete

Author:
  Gindha K, a student taking the computer science principles class. I have experience with debates dealing with gender identity and questioning whether or not there are really more than four of the existing genders. I also find it interesting to see which names are defined as female or male. 
  
Purpose:
  The purpose of this CRUD website is for users to document their name and their gender. The user can do this by typing their name and gender in the corresponding boxes that are titled name and gender respectively. After this information is entered, the user will be able click the save button, which will submit the data to the server. Users also have the ablitiy to look at what information others have entered into the website. The information entered will be connected to a mySQL database, which  holds all the information, and users have the ability to update and/or delete their names and gender as need be.
  
Programming Languages used:
  PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

Reason of creation:
  This website was created because I wanted to give the users a simplistic way of submitting their name and gender. This information would allow me to see which first names are associated most commonly with which of the wide array of genders.
  
How the website was made:
  The crud website was made by using cloud 9 as the host of the programming files created. After creating a folder in cloud 9, individual progromming files were then created in that folder as necessary to create a functioning crud website.
